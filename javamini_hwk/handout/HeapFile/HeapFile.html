Assignment 1:  Heap Files<BR>
Due: Wednesday, September 27, 1996, at 5 p.m.<BR>
Instructors:  Jeff Naughton and Raghu Ramakrishnan<BR>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
Welcome to Minibase, a new version of the Minirel system that has been
used in the CS564 course project for many years.   Minibase is a small
relational DBMS, structured  into several layers.  In this assignment,
you will  implement the Heap file layer.   You will  be given the code
for the lower layers (Buffer Manager and Disk  Space Manager), as well
as the code for managing records on a Heap file page.
<P>
<I>You will carry out this assignment, and subsequent ones, in teams
of two.  Please choose a partner as soon  as possible, or send mail to
michaell so that we can find a partner for you.</I>
<P>
This assignment has three parts.  You have to do the following:
<OL>
<LI>
Familiarize  yourself with the  Heap  file, HFPage, Buffer Manager and
Disk Space Manager interfaces.
<LI>
Implement the Heap file class.  You can ignore concurrency control and
recovery issues,   and  concentrate   on implementing  the   interface
routines.  You should deal with free space intelligently, using either
a  linked  list or  page  directory to   identify pages  with room for
records.  When  a record is deleted,  you must update your information
about available  free space, and when a  record is inserted,  you must
try to use free space on existing pages before allocating a new page.
<LI>
Run the tests provided by the TA.
</OL>
<P>
<H4>Available Documentation</H4>
<P>
You should begin by reading the chapter  on Disks and Files (available
at MACC),  to get an overview of  the HF layer  and buffer management.
This  material  was   also  covered in    class.    In addition,  HTML
documentation   is available for  Minibase,  which  you can read using
Netscape.  There is a link to the Minibase home page in the CS564 home
page.
<P>
<H3>Classes to Familiarize Yourself With First</H3>
<P>
There are four main classes with which you should
familiarize yourself: HeapFile, HFPage, BufferMgr, DB.
A Heap file is seen as a collection of records.  Internally,
records are stored on a collection of HFPage objects.
The code for all these classes will be given to you, with the
exception of HeapFile of course.
<P>
<H3>Compiling Your Code and Running the Tests</H3>
<P>
Copy all the files  from <I>/p/course/cs564-1/assigns95/assign1</I> to
your own local assign1 directory  and study them carefully.  The files
are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Makefile:</I>  A sample Makefile  for  you to compile  your project.
Study this carefully before you make changes.  You will notice that in
order  to compile your code, you  will have to link in the
library for the  buffer manager, the disk space manager and the record
manager  <I>/p/course/cs564-1/assigns95/libs/lib1.a</I>).  You need not
copy this to your directory.  The Makefile automatically compiles your
files and links in this library.  <I>You  should use the gnu version
of `make', which is in</I> <TT>/usr/psup/bin</TT>.
<P>
<LI>
There are several header files, the ones you have to look at are:
<OL>
<LI> <I>heapfile.h</I> -- heapfile class
<LI> <I>hfpage.h</I> -- hfpage class (a page of the heapfile)
<LI> <I>buf.h</I> -- buffer manager class
<LI> <I>db.h</I> -- the db class
<LI> <I>new_error.h</I> -- the error protocol.
</OL>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>What to Turn In, and When</H3>
<P>
You should turn  in copies of  your code  together with  copies of the
output produced   by running  the  tests  provided  by the   TAs.  The
assignment is due at 5PM on September 27th.  The solution will be made
public after that time,  and solutions turned in  after that time will
not receive any credit.  So be sure to turn in whatever you have, even
if it is not working fully, at that time.
<P>
<I>I emphasize  that late submissions  will not receive  any credit.
Computers --  and life! --  being   what   they are, expect
everything  to  take  longer   than  you   expect, even    taking this
expectation into account.  So start  early, and plan on getting things
done well before the due  date.  Nothing short  of a nuclear explosion
(in the CS building, not the South Pacific) constitutes a valid reason
for an extension.</I>
