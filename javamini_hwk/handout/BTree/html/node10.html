A Note on the Due Date</A>
</H1>
<P>
This project should take you about two weeks to finish.  Unfortunately,
that would make this due around October 30, which is the date of our
midterm exam.  Since your instructors are such nice people, they have
decided not to have you finishing your assignment at the same time
you are preparing for the midterm.
<P>
However, we would strongly urge you to begin the assignment as if
it were due in two weeks.  Then you can take some time out to prepare
for the midterm, and will be in good shape to finish in the week
following that.  If you wait until after the midterm to start, you
will be unlikely to finish.
