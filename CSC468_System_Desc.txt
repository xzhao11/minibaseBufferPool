CSC 468 Final Project

We modified the Minibase DBMS with 3 new buffer pool algorithms.
The existing system had support for the Clock, Most Recently Used (MRU), and Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithms.
We added support for the Least Frequently Used (LFU), Last In First Out (LIFO), and Random choice algorithms.

LFU:

LIFO:
This algorithm was implemented as a LIFO stack as a simple array in Java. 
While an ArrayList would be easier to work with, the existing codebase used the array implementation in other areas so it was used here as well.

When new frames were added to the buffer pool they were added to the top of the stack until the stack was full.
When the buffer pool was full, any new frames just overrote the top frame of the stack (the first frame in the array) since it was the last one in.


Random:
